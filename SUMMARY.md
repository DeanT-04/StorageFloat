# ModelFloat MVP — Project Summary

**Project:** ModelFloat — Free Cloud-Based Floating Storage System for Open Source AI Models  
**Version:** MVP  
**Author:** DeanT-04  
**Date:** 2025-06-24

## Overview

ModelFloat is a free, cloud-based floating storage system for open source AI models. It leverages distributed storage (MEGA, Google Drive, IPFS) and modular orchestration to enable upload, fragmentation, distributed storage, retrieval, and reassembly of models, all accessible via a REST API.

---

## MVP Architecture

- **Fragmentation:** Splits model files into fixed-size fragments.
- **Storage Adapters:** Uploads/downloads fragments to/from MEGA, Google Drive, and IPFS.
- **Distribution:** Distributes fragments across multiple providers for redundancy.
- **Metadata Registry:** Tracks models, fragments, and storage locations in a JSON file.
- **Assembler:** Retrieves and reassembles fragments into the original model file.
- **REST API:** FastAPI endpoints for upload, list, and mocked inference.
- **Testing:** Full unit test coverage for all modules and API.

## Key Modules

- `src/metadata_registry.py` — JSON-based metadata registry
- `src/fragmenter.py` — File fragmentation logic
- `src/storage_mega.py`, `src/storage_gdrive.py`, `src/storage_ipfs.py` — Storage adapters
- `src/distributor.py` — Fragment distribution logic
- `src/assembler.py` — Fragment retrieval and assembly
- `src/api.py` — FastAPI REST API
- `src/test_*.py` — Unit tests for all modules

---

## Current State

- **All MVP features implemented and tested**
- **All tests passing (26/26, pytest)**
- **Milestones and tasks fully tracked and documented**
- **Ready for future enhancements and production integration**

---

## Next Steps / Future Work

- Integrate real fragment logic into the API endpoints
- Update datetime handling to use timezone-aware objects
- Expand provider support and add user authentication
- Productionize deployment and add monitoring
